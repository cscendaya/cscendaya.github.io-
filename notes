Your website must showcase a bit about yourself and your skills, interests, projects, and achievements. You will apply what you have learned so far about the basics of HTML and CSS, layouting using Flex and Grid, responsive design, and basics of animations and transitions. I encourage everyone to explore, be creative and let your personality shine through.
