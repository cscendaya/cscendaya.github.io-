 <h1>Learning Task 1: Personal Website</h1>

<h2>Concept Application</h2>

Creating this website, I encountered a lot of good circumstances and bad circumstances. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the process. 

Applying the concepts I learned based from the past activities, it helped me tremendously to practice how the basics of HTML, CSS, and a bit of Javascript work. Throughout the process, I searched a lot of references and video tutorials. Using those knowledge, I tried to create the website from scratch, with assistance of the video tutorial from youtuber 'How to become a developer". It was indeed difficult, because there are a lot of things to consider and to adjust so it is best to tread carefully. 

In terms of CONTENT, HTML basics was applied. Tags like 'section', 'div', and many more were applied for the structure of the website. I also used some 'href' tags for the links and links within the website. CSS tags and selectors were utilized for the DESIGN and CREATIVITY. Flexboxes, tables, and borders were used and the youtube tutoriol guided me with the format and process on how to use this. Animations and transitions were also implemented in a simple way to make the website lively. There are a lot of things that I implemented similar to the youtube video, but I made sure to understand it and customize it as creative as I want to. 

<h3>LT0, LT1, and M1M2 Insights and Struggles</h3>

The past activities were a great benefit to me, because they emulated how to create website design from scratch. It is a given that there is not enough time to tackle many areas, but the foundation for exploring such topics were easier to improve because of the activities. The HTML and CSS part were an enjoyable experience for me, because there were a lot of references to look at, and they're all essential. The struggle on the other hand, is in the javascript part. As a person whose weakness is coding and experimenting with it, there were a lot of processes that is complex for me. But again, the foundation for learning it is in the activity, and I am thankful for that. The javascript activity was really mind-boggling for me, but I appreciate that the essential part of javascript were tackled. 

<h3>Website Improvements</h3>

The website is definitely simple to look at. This is because my goal is to familiarize myself with a lot of concepts as much as I can. Thankfully, I achieved that, but I still have much to explore and master. It isn't as smooth or professional-looking compared to usual portfolio websites, but I am satisfied with it right now, considering that I achieved the possibilities that I thought I couldn't do. However, there are many things that I hadn't achieved. 

For me, flexboxes are a great tool to use, because of its complexity. But because of that complexity, it was difficult for me to understand it even until now. I still have much to practice and experiment with them, and I hope that in my next projects, I can be comfortable using them. Margins and positions were also a complicated matter for me. So, I would like to learn more about it when I can next time. 

Additionally, the whole structure of the website is too simple. I also realized that just creating a vague structural idea of the website through handwriting is not enough, so I have to utilize tools like figma to better prepare and strategize how to create websites. 

Lastly, the media query part was an area that I haven't explored much with. It was evident especially in the part that I have to manually adjust some images and structures to create the ideal look for them when resized. The arrow (to redirect to a certain part in the website) placement were hard for me to finalize. I believe this is where my lack of flexbox and div/class/id knowledge comes in. I really hope to improve this because the whole structure was honestly messy to look at, and there were some redundancies in my code. 

<h3>Other Remarks</h3>

Overall, it was a rollercoaster ride for me. I spent a lot of days and spent a lot of hours on a lot of small processes here and there in this website, but I am thankful that I learned to understand and manipulate them in any way I need and want. Though it is not as clean as I thought (especially in the coding part of it), it's okay because I realized the flaws and improvement I can do to be a better web developer.
